# Todo-app
The required To-do tasks app has been designed using HTML, CSS for the frontend and Python-flask to manage the backend, wherein the status of the tasks is stored and updated as per the requirement. By default, each task will be incomplete.

Each task will have two buttons to update the status:
1.	Complete: when the task is completed, user can click the status button and the status will be updated.
2.	Delete: user can also delete the task as per the requirement. The task will be updated in the backend.
